# goals (suggested)
- explain why we need (Bayesian) hierarchical modeling
- provide an overview of the flexibility using this approach (JAGS, e.g. nonlinear models)
- run simulations demonstrating the benefit over classical estimation (e.g. small N, asymptotics)
- discuss the problems of calculating Bayes factors
